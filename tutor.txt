     Vim is a very powerful editor that has many commands, too many to
     explain in a tutor such as this.  This tutor is designed to describe
     enough of the commands that you will be able to easily use Vim as
     an all-purpose editor.

     The approximate time required to complete the tutor is 25-30 minutes,
     depending upon how much time is spent with experimentation.

     ATTENTION:
     The commands in the lessons will modify the text.  Make a copy of this
     file to practice on (if you started "vimtutor" this is already a copy).

     It is important to remember that this tutor is set up to teach by
     use.  That means that you need to execute the commands to learn them
     properly.  If you only read the text, you will forget the commands!

     Now, make sure that your Caps-Lock key is NOT depressed and press
     the   j   key enough times to move the cursor so that lesson 1.1
     completely fills the screen.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			Lesson 1.1:  MOVING THE CURSOR


   ** To move the cursor, press the h,j,k,l keys as indicated. **
	     ^
	     k		    Hint:  The h key is at the left and moves left.
       < h	 l >		   The l key is at the right and moves right.
	     j			   The j key looks like a down arrow.
	     v
  1. Move the cursor around the screen until you are comfortable.

  2. Hold down the down key (j) until it repeats.
     Now you know how to move to the next lesson.

  3. Using the down key, move to lesson 1.2.

NOTE: If you are ever unsure about something you typed, press <ESC> to place
      you in Normal mode.  Then retype the command you wanted.

NOTE: The cursor keys should also work.  But using hjkl you will be able to
      move around much faster, once you get used to it.  Really!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			    Lesson 1.2: EXITING VIM


  !! NOTE: Before executing any of the steps below, read this entire lesson!!

  1. Press the <ESC> key (to make sure you are in Normal mode).

  2. Type:	:q! <ENTER>.
     This exits the editor, DISCARDING any changes you have made.

  3. Get back here by executing the command that got you into this tutor. That
     might be:  vimtutor <ENTER>

  4. If you have these steps memorized and are confident, execute steps
     1 through 3 to exit and re-enter the editor.

NOTE:  :q! <ENTER>  discards any changes you made.  In a few lessons you
       will learn how to save the changes to a file.

  5. Move the cursor down to lesson 1.3.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		     Lesson 1.3: TEXT EDITING - DELETION


	   ** Press  x  to delete the character under the cursor. **

  1. Move the cursor to the line below marked --->.

  2. To fix the errors, move the cursor until it is on top of the
     character to be deleted.

  4. Repeat steps 2 through 4 until the sentence is correct.

---> The cow jumped over the moon.

  5. Now that the line is correct, go on to lesson 1.4.

NOTE: As you go through this tutor, do not try to memorize, learn by usage.



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		      Lesson 1.4: TEXT EDITING - INSERTION


			** Press  i  to insert text. **

  1. Move the cursor to the first line below marked --->.

  2. To make the first line the same as the second, move the cursor on top
     of the first character AFTER where the text is to be inserted.

  3. Press  i  and type in the necessary additions.

  4. As each error is fixed press <ESC> to return to Normal mode.
     Repeat steps 2 through 4 to correct the sentence.

---> There is some text missing from this line.
